This is the implementation of Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients for Network Resource Optimization under constraints
The core princples have been derived from - Lowe et. al, "Multi-Agent Actor-Critic for Mixed Cooperative-Competitive Environments."
Link to the GitHub repository - https://github.com/openai/maddpg/tree/master".

ChatGPT-4o was used for the network_topology and radar plots. However, where there were errors, especially in the radar chart
they have been modified manually. Regardless, code generated by the tools were reviewed, tested om simpler objectives, and modified before use in the programs.

If you have any questions about the specific adaptation to network resource allocation or find any potential error in the 
implementation please reach out. Otherwise this has been created for any and all reuse without restrictions. If you find this
to be useful, please consider citing the repository as a hyperlink for now until the manuscript is in-review.

Things to Note - The run time depends on the compute resources available. This was evaluated using a humble Ryzen 5 processor with
no GPU. The run time was 2.5 hours for 250 episodes. Results obtained from this for the network resource management problem
might benefit from running more episodes or increasing the neighbourhood size, or running more training smaples per-episode. 
Application-specific heuristic modifications apply for other adaptations.
