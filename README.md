This has been focused to make use of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning paradigms to approach the chance-constrained resource allocation problem in wireless networks. 
The repository will feature 4 programs -
1. Single Agent Q-Learning
2. Multi-Agent Q-Learning
3. Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients
4. Stochastic Programming using Grid Search

The programs here are general purpose, from the perspective of wirelss communications. The underpinning principles are drawn from mobile communications with an alignment towards frequency division multiple access schemes.
This framework may get extended to problems beyond wireless communications but application-specific heuristic modifications apply.
